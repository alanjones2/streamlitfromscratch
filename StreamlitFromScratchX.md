## Layout
Streamlit tries to make life simple for the app developer and so does not have the vast number of layout options that are available in HTML and the Javascript libraries that build on it. But using its layout components you can easily design an attractive and capable web page.

The layout of a Streamlit app is constructed with various container elements, user interface components and columns.

We will look at the components that are available and how they are used.
