                        Streamlit
                        app running on Streamlit Cloud ' screenshot and app by author</em></p>
                <p>You have created an excellent Data Science app using Streamlit and it is only natural that you want
                    to
                    share it with the world.</p>
                <p>Well that's fine, because Streamlit Cloud lets you publish an unlimited number of public apps for
                    nothing. You can have an entire gallery of apps, if you want, and all the tools you need to create
                    and
                    publish them are free.</p>
                <p>In this article, we are going to go through the steps you need to take to publish your first
                    Streamlit
                    app.</p>
                <p>But first you need three things: a Streamlit Cloud account, a Github repository for each app and, to
                    make
                    life easy for yourself, an editor than plays nicely with Github (I'll be using VSCode in this
                    article).</p>
                <p>There four steps to publishing a Streamlit app:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>develop your app and test it locally</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>create a Github repository for the app</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>push the local app to Github</em></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><em>create a new app in Streamlit Cloud and connect it to the repo</em></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>There is a little setting up to do before all that will work but once done publishing and updating
                    are
                    simple.</p>
                <h3>Github</h3>
                <p>We'll start in the middle with Github. You need to set up an account, so go to the <a
                        href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> website and do that first. You'll be asked to jump through
                    a
                    few hoops to get started but nothing too difficult - just follow the instructions.</p>
                <p>There are different Github accounts but for our purposes all we need is the basic free one.</p>
                <p>Once you have an account you can create you first repository. Either click on the green <em>Create
                        repository</em> button or the <em>Start a project </em>button.</p>
                <p><img width='60%' src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2056/1*oD68W7OviiwBweOr7W0DAQ.png" /></p>
                <p>This will bring up a form for you to fill in:</p>
                <p><img width='60%' src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_oPLDWrI3UQa_-FFR4ct2g.png" /></p>
                <p>Give the repo a name (where it says 'temp' in the image above) and a description, and make sure that
                    the <em>Public</em> option is selected.</p>
                <p>You will then be asked to to specify some options. It's a good idea to create a README file, it's
                    where you can describe the purpose of the repo and its contents, so select that and it will be
                    automatically created for you.</p>
                <p><em>gitignore </em>is a way of instructing Git to ignore particular types of files that you don't
                    want
                    to include in the repo ' forget it for now, we won't be using it.</p>
                <p>Finally, choose a license and click <em>Create repository</em>.</p>
                <p><img width='60%' src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*xNuNFBJKYx1ZGHYezlXcQg.png" /></p>
                <p>You know have a place to keep the code for your Streamlit app that can be read by anyone ' mostly
                    importantly by Streamlit Cloud.</p>
                <p>You now have a basic repo that can be downloaded onto your local machine. To do this we
                    <em>clone</em>
                    the repo. Click on the code button and copy the url ' you will use this in VSCode in a moment.</p>
                <p><img width='60%' alt="Cloning a repository in GitHub"
                        src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*nNiuOkV-FOVbhPg6.png" /><em>Cloning a repository
                        in
                        GitHub ' </em></p>
                <h3>VSCode</h3>
                <p>Now let's turn to the editor. If you don't already have VSCode then download and install it, along
                    with the Python extension (I'm assuming that you have Python, already).</p>
                <p>Open VSCode, close any files or folders that you have open and select the <em>source control
                    </em>icon.
                    This gives you the option to open an existing Git repo or clone a new one. We are going to do the
                    latter.</p>
                <p><img width='30%' alt="Creating a repository in VSCode"
                        src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*2nw7kVxkMypXOa-9.png" /><em>Creating a
                        repository in
                        VSCode ' </em></p>
                <p>Click on <em>Clone Repository</em> and you'll be asked for a url - that's the one that we copied a
                    moment ago from the GitHub webpage, so paste it in.</p>
                <p>Hit return and you'll be asked whether you want to open the repo - you do, of course. It may then ask
                    if you trust the authors of the repo ' again, you do (you trust yourself, right?).</p>
                <p>After a second or two you should have something like this:</p>
                <p><img width='60%' alt="A new repository in VSCode"
                        src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*rxy2BZzKD53inAZBTxyJjA.png" /><em>A new
                        repository
                        in VSCode ' </em></p>
                <p>Now we are ready to create a new app.</p>
                <p>Here I've created a simple Streamlit app and am about to run it from the terminal window.</p>
                <p><img width='60%' alt="A new app"
                        src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2528/1*Yg7JWTBaCsMBZxnq3DLisA.png" /><em>A new app
                    </em></p>
                <p>It runs ok:</p>
                <p><img width='60%' alt="Sample app"
                        src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ArPRiYkwbvVqVGdQpM03NQ.png" /><em>Sample app
                    </em></p>
                <p>So now we are ready to upload it to our new Github repo.</p>
                <p>Notice that, in VSCode, the source control icon now has a notification ' this is because something
                    has
                    changed. Open the source control icon again and and you can see that <em>Changes</em> lists
                    <em>stapp1.py</em>.
                </p>
                <h3>A quick word about Git</h3>
                <p>Git is the source control system used by Github,</p>
                <p>Fundamentally, it tracks any changes that you make in you code - edit a file and Git knows about it.
                    But in order to update a project, you need to <em>commit</em> the changes. There are two parts to
                    <em>commiting</em>, first you add the files you want to the commit - that's called staging - and
                    then you actually commit the changes with a short message (typically describing what changes you
                    have
                    made). In this way Git keeps a repository of code which contains the up-to-date files for the latest
                    version along with a history of what changes have been made.
                </p>
                <p>Once a version of your code is <em>commited </em>it can be <em>pushed</em> to a remote repository
                    like
                    GitHub and shared with the world (or your team).</p>
                <p>Conversely, a version of the code can be <em>pulled</em> from the remote repository to a local
                    machine to
                    be worked on there and then pushed back to the remote repository when you've finished.</p>
                <h3>Back to the app</h3>
                <p>We can now commit our change by typing in a commit message and hitting Ctrl+Enter.</p>
                <p><img width='60%' src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*vkL0dyM67nm4eQkIy8bZyg.png" /></p>
                <p>Now since we haven't <em>staged</em> the change, VSCode asks if you would like to automatically stage
                    them and whether you should always do this (or never). I never bother to stage things because I
                    always
                    want all my changes to be in the commit ' if you want the same then choose <em>Yes</em> or
                    <em>Always</em>. If you choose <em>Never</em>, you will have to do the staging manually.
                </p>
                <p><img width='40%' alt="Automatic staging"
                        src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*qwjOzVm6vIFiFvU3.png" /><em>Automatic staging
                    </em></p>
                <p>You should now notice that the notification has gone.</p>
                <p>Now the whole point of us doing all this is to keep our code on GitHub so having made a change we now
                    need to push it there.</p>
                <p><img width='40%' src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*E9q3Y0pn9KB-pLzr3-q48w.png" /></p>
                <p>Just click the blue button and the changes will be pushed to your Github repo.</p>
                <p>The first time you do this GitHub needs to know that you are authorized to push to your repo. First
                    step:
                </p>
                <p><img width='40%' src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*LtZ9O54ANK3P8QLy.png" /></p>
                <p>This brings up a browser window and asks you log in to GitHub in the usual way to confirm that VSCode
                    can
                    use your account.</p>
                <p>When you've done that the local repo will be pushed to GitHub.</p>
                <p>Success!</p>
                <p>We have created our app, pushed it to Github and now all we have to do is tell Streamlit Cloud about
                    it!
                </p>
                <h3>Streamlit Cloud</h3>
                <p>There are a few plans that you can sign up to. The one we want is the <em>Starter </em>plan. This is
                    free
                    and let's you publish an unlimited number of public Streamlit apps (and one private one).</p>
                <p>So go to the <a href="https://streamlit.io/cloud">Streamlit Cloud web page</a> and scroll down until
                    you
                    find the sign-up section. When I signed up, I had to do so with either my Google or Github account,
                    which is fine by me, but I believe other signup options are in the pipeline. I signed up with Github
                    and, of course, Streamlit Cloud needs to be able to access your Github repositories in order to
                    access
                    your apps.</p>
                <p>Once you've sorted out your Streamlit Cloud account the rest is plain sailing.</p>
                <p><img width='60%' src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3502/1*Yux3wILpnhxLZ1ookbUIFQ.png" /></p>
                <p>Click on <em>New App </em>and you will be asked for the details of your app:</p>
                <p><img width='60%' src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2002/1*taPdyV_v-9JG7W5NjiBkVQ.png" /></p>
                <p>Type in the repository path and the name of the Streamlit app file and click <em>Deploy </em>(the
                    Branch
                    stays as 'main').</p>
                <p>Streamlit now appears to be 'baking' your app:</p>
                <p><img width='60%' src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3020/1*9NL0PgzisRXY9UqBgFrcSA.png" /></p>
                <p>The panel on the right tells you what is actually going on, while the icon on the left cycles through
                    a
                    variety of foodstuffs (the one above is supposed to be a potato).</p>
                <p>After a while you get a burst of cartoon balloons to celebrate the fact that you app is ready for
                    consumption and it duly appears on the screen.</p>
                <p>And that is it. You can go through the with as many public apps as you like. The only real restraint
                    is
                    that if your app doesn't receive much traffic, Streamlit puts it to sleep in order not to waste
                    resources. When asleep the app is still available but it will have to go through the ÔÇÿbaking'
                    process again before it runs. Streamlit will send you a friendly email telling you when they are
                    going
                    to do this and suggesting that, if you want to you can simply visit your app to prevent it from
                    dozing
                    off.</p>
                <p>So we have seen just how straightforward it is to publish your Streamlit app using entirely free
                    tools. I
                    hope it has been useful and that I'll see your apps in the Cloud soon. Please do drop a comment
                    below
                    with a link if you do that. You can find some of my simple efforts <a
