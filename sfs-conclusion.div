<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So, we have covered quite a lot in this set of tutorials: how to get started with Streamlit and create your first web app; how we can add various media to that app; presenting data as text and tables, and as charts; and we hace concluded with how to use Streamlit's UI components and layout feature to construct three different data dashboard apps.</p>
<p>There are more Streamlit features that we could cover but with the ones that we have looked at here you create useful data dashboard apps.</p>
